# ESP-GraphQL demo svelte app

This is a demo UI for ESP-GraphQL experiment. Based project template for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) apps. 
Update `src/settings.js` to your setup.

## Get started

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*
Install the dependencies...

```bash
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash

```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.
